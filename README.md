# Julian Day Compatibility methods for Chrono

This library provides compatibility with astronomical applications that use Julian Days as 64-bit floats. A *Julian Day* represents the number of days since the beginning of the Julian period, which started at 12 noon on November 24, 4713 BCE (-4713-11-24T12:00:00 UTC). Julian Days facilitate calculations over extended periods and should not be confused with the Julian Calendar, which affects leap year rules.

This crate adds three traits and six utility methods to Rust's standard datetime crate, Chrono, as well as standalone functions to convert to and from Unix timestamps. All date-time values are in UTC but can be converted to a timezone-aware *chrono::DateTime*.

Please note that Julian Day values as 64-bit floats are always rounded to the nearest second when converted to Unix time or *chrono::NaiveDateTime*.

### 0.3.3 Release Notes
The core `to_jd()` and `from_jd(jd: f64)` methods have been updated to ensure future compatibility with the *chrono* crate by replacing all calls to deprecated methods with the newer methods introduced in version 0.4.31, which is now the minimum supported version.

The core `from_jd(jd: f64)` conversion method now only works within a range from `-9999-01-01T00:00:00` to `9999-12-31T23:59:59`. However, `unixtime_to_julian_day(timestamp: i64)` and `julian_day_to_unixtime(jd: f64)` work within a much wider range supported by i64 and f64 respectively.

The supplementary fuzzy-datetime conversion functions have been marked as *deprecated* and have been reimplemented with a broader range of options in [fuzzy-datetime](https://crates.io/crates/fuzzy-datetime).

A similar [julianday](https://crates.io/crates/julianday) crate exists to handle Julian days as integers and converts them to *chrono::NaiveDate* only. I developed this crate primarily to ensure interoperability with an [Astrological API server](https://github.com/neilg63/astro-calc-api) that leverages the [Swiss Ephemeris](https://github.com/aloistr/swisseph) calculation engine.

NB: 0.3.4 contains editorial changes only.

## Direct functions

### unixtime_to_julian_day(ts: i64) -> f64
Converts a unix timestamp directly to Julian days as a 64-bit float, compatible with many astronomical applications.

### julian_day_to_unixtime(jd: f64) -> i64
Converts a Julian Day as a signed 64-bit integer. If the timestamp has to be cast to a 32-bit integers, dates before 1902 and after 2038 will be out of range.

### julian_day_to_weekday_index(jd: f64, offset_secs: i32) -> u8
Calculates the weekday index, where Sunday = 0, Monday = 1 and Saturday = 6. This will work for any historical or future Julian Day, whether or not it can be converted to a NaiveDateTime object.

### julian_day_to_datetime(jd: f64) -> Result<NaiveDateTime, ParsedError>
Converts a valid Julian Day within a range of -9999-01-01 to 9999-12-31 to NaiveDateTime, assumed to be UTC. This is the same as `NaiveDateTime::from_js()`, except it returns a `Result` rather than an `Option`.

## Traits

## JulianDay
must implement:
- ```to_jd(&self) -> f64```
- ```from_jd(jd: f64) -> Option<Self>```


## WeekdayIndex
must implement:
- ```weekday_index(&self, offset_secs: i32) -> u8```

If the solar or standard local timezone offset is known, this calculates the weekday index (Sunday = 0, Monday = 1 ... Saturday = 6) for timezone-neutral DateTime objects. The solar timezone offset in seconds can be calculated from the longitude as 1ยบ = 240 seconds, e.g. -3ยบ (or 3ยบW) would be -720.

## Usage

```rust
use chrono::NaiveDateTime;
use julian_day_converter::*;

fn main() {
    // Convert a sample Julian Day value to a valid NaiveDateTime object and then use to_jd() for interoperability
    // with astronomical applications
    // The return value is a result consistent with other parse functions
    // julian_day_to_datetime(jd_value) is equivalent to NaiveDateTime::from_jd(jd_value)
    let sample_julian_day = 2459827.25;
    if let Ok(date_time) = julian_day_to_datetime(sample_julian_day) {
      let formatted_date_time_string = date_time.format("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S").to_string();
      println!("The Julian day {} is {} as ISO date-time", sample_julian_day, formatted_date_time_string);
    }
  
    let historical_jd = 2334317.39336563;
    // Convert to a NaiveDateTime object and then apply its format method
    // The return value is an options consistent with other chrono::NaiveDateTime constructors
    if let Some(date_time) = NaiveDateTime::from_jd(historical_jd) {
      let formatted_date_time_string = date_time.format("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S").to_string();
      println!("The meteorite landed on Earth at {} Julian days or {}", historical_jd, formatted_date_time_string);
    }

    let historical_datetime = "1876-09-25T15:45:00";
    // Convert to a NaiveDateTime object and then apply its format method
    // The return value is an options consistent with other chrono::NaiveDateTime constructors
    if let Ok(date_time) = NaiveDateTime::from_str(historical_datetime) {
      let jd = date_time.to_jd();
      println!("The date {} is {} in Julian days", historical_datetime, jd);
    }

    let prehistoric_julian_day = -190338.875;
    // Convert to a NaiveDateTime object and then apply its format method
    // The return value is a result consistent with other parse functions
    if let Some(date_time) = NaiveDateTime::from_jd(prehistoric_julian_day) {
      let formatted_date_time_string = date_time.format("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S").to_string();
      println!("An asteroid hit the Earth at {} Julian days or {}", prehistoric_julian_day, formatted_date_time_string);
    }

    let unix_timestamp = 169938309;
    // does not require conversion to a NaiveDateTime object
    let jd = unixtime_to_julian_day(unix_timestamp);
    println!("All valid 64 bit integers can be converted to Julian days, e.g. {} is {} Julian days", unix_timestamp, jd);
    
    let julian_day = 2134937.3937f64;
    // does not require conversion to a NaiveDateTime object
    let ts = julian_day_to_unixtime(julian_day);
    println!("Some historical and far-future Julian days may yield very big timestamp values e.g. {} is {} as a unix timestamp", julian_day, ts);
  
  }

```

### Deprecated Trait and Functions
#### FromFuzzyISOString (deprecated) 
Available in [fuzzy-datetime](https://crates.io/crates/fuzzy-datetime):

- ```from_fuzzy_iso_string(&self, dt_str: &str) -> Option<Self>```

These functions are now deprecated and will be removed from version 0.4.0 but will be available in a separate crate [fuzzy-datetime](https://crates.io/crates/fuzzy-datetime) with more advanced date-time string interpretation and correction.

- `datetime_to_julian_day(dt_str: &str) -> Result<f64, ParsedError> (deprecated)`
- `iso_fuzzy_string_to_datetime(dt: &str) -> Result<NaiveDateTime, ParsedError> (deprecated)`
These methods convert fuzzy ISO-like strings to either to Julian day value or NaiveDateTime objects as shown below.


```rust
// Convert an approximate date-time string to a valid NaiveDateTime object and then use to_jd() for interoperability
// with astronomical applications
// The return value is a result consistent with other parse functions
let approx_date_time = "2023-11-09 15"; // 3pm 
if let Some(date_time) = NaiveDateTime::from_fuzzy_iso_string(approx_date_time) {
  let formatted_date_time_string = date_time.format("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S").to_string();
  println!("The input time of `{}` is assumed to be {} UTC and in Julian Days is {}", approx_date_time, formatted_date_time_string, date_time.to_jd());
}
```
